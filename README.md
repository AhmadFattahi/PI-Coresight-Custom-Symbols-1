# PI Coresight 3 Extensibility Samples and Tutorials
## About
This repository is set up to help you learn how to add a custom symbol or tool pane, created with JavaScript and HTML, to PI Coresight 3.

## Repository Sections
This repository is broken down into two separate sections, tutorials and community samples. The tutorials section contains multiple walkthroughs, with documentation, about how to create very specific new symbols in PI Coresight. The community samples section contains sample symbols and panes submitted by OSIsoft and the community to showcase what they have done with PI Coresight's extensibilty model.
