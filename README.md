# PI Coresight 3 Extensibility Samples and Tutorials
## About
This repository is set up to help you learn how to add a custom symbol, created with JavaScript and HTML, to PI Coresight 3, which is currently in beta. You will 'register' a custom symbol to add it to the available 'symbol library' and learn how to access data for the symbol when it is placed on a display. You will also learn how the symbol and application can interact with each other in ways such as responding to time range changes. Finally, you will see how the symbol is persisted with the display and hooked into the undo/redo system.

## Repository Sections
This repository is broken down into two separate sections, tutorials and community samples. The tutorials section contains multiple walkthroughs, with documentation, about how to create very specific new symbols in PI Coresight. The community samples section contains sample symbols submitted by OSIsoft and the community show what they have done with PI Coresight's extensibilty model.
